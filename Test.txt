Testing git setup. Learn it thoroughly before using Git for actual usage.

First go to your local Git directory.

$ git config --global user.name "jatin009" //setting username

$ git config --global user.email email_id  //setting email id

$ git clone https://github.com/jatin009/testfirst.git  //checking out git files

$ git add Test.txt	//Adding a file to git

$ git status	//To know of the addition, deletion or modification status of files in this directory.

$ git commit -m "first commit" Test.txt	//Commiting the file

$ git push -u origin master	//Pushing to the git repository.

####### Branch switching ########

$ git checkout -b new_branch_name existing_branch	//Creating new branch based on existing branch.

$ git checkout <branch_name> //Switch to branch <branch_name>

$ git branch //to see branches handled locally "git branch -a" for all branches

$ git reset --hard //above "git checkout <branch_name>" might prevent switching due to conflicts. Use this command to drop all changes before switching.

$ git pull // to sync remote branch with current local branch. This might require pre-removal of some files/directory 

$ git branch -d <branch_name> // remove a branch locally

$ git fetch // "git branch -a" may skip some branches particularly added after u checked out, so use "git fetch" first and then "git branch -a"

That's it for now.
